## Fox-Jump-Game
A Jumping PyGame

== description ==

Fox Jump is a one-player game coded in PyGame. The aim is to jump as many stairs as possible before the stairs disappear below. 
Your score is counted. The game is made with lovely pixel art of fox and stairs.

== controls ==

Backspace - jump
Left arrow - move to left
Right arrow - move to right 

== inspiration ==

I was inspired by a YouTube video of a simple jumping game. I can't find the video anymore, unforutunately. 

### Enjoy!
